## Introduction 
 Welcome to my repository. This repository was created and designed by me. Here I am going to use and explain how i implemented the Algorithm "Doubly Linked List". Before we get  started with the Code Implementation, I would like to give a small "Crashcourse"  about the differences of "Single Linked List" and "Doubly Linked List".
 
# Linked List 

Every Node at a Linked List has 2 Parts of data. 
- One which contains the value of the node.
- A Pointer that has link to the next Value of the list

The Linked List stores their values in terms of "Nodes" or also called "containers". 
Each Node contains a value and points at directly to the next Value of the upcoming Node. 

The starting point of a Node is called **root**.



# Doubly Linked List
> The alternative Verison of a Linked List 

A Doubly Linked List is just like a Linked List but in Addition the Values of the Node has a link to the previous Value.

It Conatains following values: 
- Pointer to the previous Value of the list.
- The actual Value of the Node 
- Pointer to the next Value of the list.

A Doubly Linked List knows the has a link from the previous Node and a link to next Node of the list.
